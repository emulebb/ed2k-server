# ed2k-server

A modern, open-source **eDonkey2000 / eMule index server**, written from scratch
in **Rust**. It is a clean-room replacement for the long-unmaintained,
closed-source *Lugdunum* eserver — built to be lean, memory-efficient, and
stable at the scale of the largest real eD2k servers (tens of millions of files).

> **eMuleBB fork status:** `emulebb/ed2k-server` is a managed Service/Lab fork
> of [`andrey23127/ed2k-server`](https://github.com/andrey23127/ed2k-server).
> It has reproducible workspace and GitHub CI builds, but it is not yet used by
> the eMuleBB test harness; deterministic tests continue to use
> [`emulebb/goed2k-server`](https://github.com/emulebb/goed2k-server). Upstream
> changes are reviewed and merged manually from the `upstream` remote.

## Features

- Full eD2k protocol: TCP (login, search, get-sources, offer-files) and **UDP**
  (search, get-sources, server pings, server-to-server gossip) — UDP is the bulk
  of real-world traffic.
- Inverted keyword index with boolean search trees and numeric size filters.
  Results are ranked by source count, the result cap is configurable, and a
  query word no indexed file contains no longer empties the search.
- Memory-optimized in-memory index (sharded slab, intrusive hash index, name
  interning, jemalloc tuning) — roughly **half the RAM** of the Lugdunum
  reference at the same scale.
- **Mandatory multi-layer CSAM content filter** on every published file
  (age+context heuristics in code; operator-supplied jargon, hash, and
  extra-term lists loaded at runtime — see *Content filter* below).
- Server-to-server **gossip** with obfuscation; mldonkey/junk-server filtering
  via verification.
- **NAT traversal (NAT-T)** hole-punch coordination for LowID↔LowID transfers.
- **IPv6** (opt-in): clients can connect over IPv6, and a client that is LowID on
  IPv4 but has a public IPv6 is published as an IPv6 source to peers that can
  parse it — see *IPv6* below.
- HighID verified by a client-to-client hello, not only a TCP connect: a port
  forwarded to a *different* client behind the same NAT no longer earns HighID.
- IP filtering in eMule **guarding.p2p** format, with per-range hit statistics.
- GeoIP country stats, bot/scanner detection, CSAM-publisher banning.
- Built-in **admin web panel** (status, clients, peers, filters, blocks,
  settings) bound to localhost.
- Hot-reloadable filter lists and config without a restart.

> Status: production-used test/MVP build (v0.9.x). The protocol surface is
> complete and running live; expect ongoing iteration.

## Language & dependencies

- **Rust** (edition 2021, `rust-version >= 1.75`), async on **Tokio**.
- Memory allocator: **jemalloc** (`tikv-jemallocator`) on non-MSVC targets.
- Web panel: **axum**. All dependency versions are pinned in `Cargo.toml`.

## System requirements

- **Linux x86-64.** Developed and tested on **Debian 13 (codename trixie)**. Other
  modern distributions (Ubuntu, etc.) work the same way.
- A Rust toolchain (`rustc` / `cargo`) ≥ 1.75 — install via [rustup](https://rustup.rs).
- Build tools: a C compiler and `make` (jemalloc-sys builds a small C library).
  On Debian/Ubuntu: `sudo apt install build-essential`.
- RAM scales with index size. A small/medium server runs comfortably in a few
  hundred MB; planning for tens of millions of files, budget ~10–13 GB.
- Raise the open-file limit for production (see *systemd service* below).

## Building

### On a Linux VPS

```bash
# 1. Install Rust (if not present)
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
source "$HOME/.cargo/env"
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y build-essential

# 2. Get the source
git clone https://github.com/andrey23127/ed2k-server.git
cd ed2k-server

# 3. Build (release)
cargo build --release

# Binary: target/release/ed2k-server
```

### Under WSL on Windows

The server is Linux software; on Windows build it inside **WSL** (a real Linux
environment), not native Windows.

```powershell
# In PowerShell (once): install WSL with Debian
wsl --install -d Debian
```

Then open the **Debian** (WSL) shell and follow the exact same Linux steps
above (`rustup`, `apt install build-essential`, `cargo build --release`). The
resulting binary is a Linux binary — run it inside WSL, or copy it to your VPS.

### CPU optimization via `.cargo/config.toml`

The repo ships a portable `.cargo/config.toml` that bakes the jemalloc memory
tuning into the binary for everyone. It also contains **commented-out** examples
for tuning the binary to a specific CPU. Uncomment **one** block that matches the
machine that will *run* the binary:

- `target-cpu=native` — optimize for the build host (safe if you build on the
  same machine you deploy to).
- `target-cpu=znver3` — AMD Zen 3 (Ryzen 5000 / EPYC 7003). This is what the
  reference VPS uses. Other values: `znver2`, `znver4`, `skylake`,
  `icelake-server`, or `x86-64-v3` (portable baseline for most CPUs since ~2015).

> A binary built for a specific `target-cpu` must only run on that CPU family or
> newer, or it will crash with an illegal-instruction error. When in doubt, leave
> all CPU blocks commented out — the default build runs anywhere.

You can confirm the jemalloc tuning was embedded at runtime:

```bash
ps -T -p $(pgrep -f ed2k-server) | grep jemalloc   # a jemalloc_bg_thd thread = OK
```

---

## Installing on a VPS

### 1. Place the binary

```bash
sudo install -m 0755 target/release/ed2k-server /usr/local/bin/ed2k-server
```

### 2. Configuration and data files in `/etc/ed2k-server`

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /etc/ed2k-server
sudo cp config/config.vps.toml /etc/ed2k-server/config.toml   # then edit the CHANGE_ME fields
```

Put your runtime data files here too and point the config at them:

- **`ip-to-country.csv`** — GeoIP database for the admin panel's country stats.
  Download and unpack it from
  **https://upd.emule-security.org/ip-to-country.csv.zip**:
  ```bash
  cd /etc/ed2k-server
  curl -O https://upd.emule-security.org/ip-to-country.csv.zip
  unzip ip-to-country.csv.zip      # produces ip-to-country.csv
  ```
  Set `storage.country_db_path = "/etc/ed2k-server/ip-to-country.csv"`.

- **`guarding.p2p`** — IP blocklist in eMule format (same format used by
  emule-security). Set `storage.ipfilter_path = "/etc/ed2k-server/guarding.p2p"`.

- **Content filter lists** (optional but recommended — see *Content filter*).

Keeping those files current by hand is tedious, and the term and hash lists are
not published in this repository. See **[UPDATE-SERVICE.md](UPDATE-SERVICE.md)**
for pulling them from an update service — or running one — including the
signature checks that make an automatic update safe.

### 3. Run as a systemd service

A ready unit is in `contrib/ed2k-server.service`. Install it:

```bash
sudo cp contrib/ed2k-server.service /etc/systemd/system/ed2k-server.service
# edit paths if needed
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable --now ed2k-server
sudo systemctl status ed2k-server
```

Reload filter lists / config live (no downtime):

```bash
sudo systemctl reload ed2k-server      # sends SIGHUP
```

The unit (excerpt — full file in `contrib/`):

```ini
[Unit]
Description=ed2k index server
After=network-online.target
Wants=network-online.target

[Service]
Type=simple
User=root
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/ed2k-server --config /etc/ed2k-server/config.toml
ExecReload=/bin/kill -HUP $MAINPID
Restart=on-failure
RestartSec=5
StandardOutput=null
StandardError=null
LimitNOFILE=1048576
OOMScoreAdjust=-500

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

> **`LimitNOFILE` matters — size it to `max_clients`, not to the file index.**
> The default 1024 file-descriptor limit is fatally low. File-descriptor usage
> tracks **concurrent client connections**, not the number of indexed files: the
> 33M-entry index lives entirely in RAM and consumes **zero** descriptors. Budget
> roughly one fd per connected client, plus ~10–20 fixed (one TCP + five UDP
> listeners, the admin socket, logging) and a transient margin for outbound HighID
> probes and ephemeral gossip sockets during login storms.
>
> Rule of thumb: **`LimitNOFILE` ≈ 2 × `max_clients`**. The shipped `65536` is
> ample for the default `max_clients = 1000`. For a large public server it is
> **tight**: at `max_clients = 50000` it leaves only ~15k headroom, which a login
> burst (each new HighID login opens a short-lived outbound probe socket) can eat
> into. For 50k clients prefer **`131072`**; scale up from there if you raise
> `max_clients` further.

### ⚠️ Logging is OFF by default — on purpose

The provided unit sends `StandardOutput`/`StandardError` to **`/dev/null`**.
**On a busy server, logs grow very fast** and can fill the disk. Logging is
therefore disabled by default. To enable it for troubleshooting:

1. In the unit, change `StandardOutput=null` / `StandardError=null` to `journal`.
2. Optionally set `Environment=RUST_LOG=ed2k_server=debug` for verbose tracing.
3. `systemctl daemon-reload && systemctl restart ed2k-server`, then
   `journalctl -u ed2k-server -f`.

Turn it back off once you're done — `debug` especially is extremely chatty.

## Configuration reference

Edit `/etc/ed2k-server/config.toml`. The table below lists the settings and
whether a change applies **live** (via `systemctl reload` / SIGHUP, or by editing
a watched file) or needs a **restart**.

> Rule of thumb: filter lists apply live; anything that changes a listening
> socket needs a restart. When unsure, restart.

### `[server]`
| Key | Meaning | Apply |
|---|---|---|
| `name`, `desc` | Server name / description shown to clients | restart |
| `public` | If `true`, requires a non-empty hash blocklist (enforced) | restart |
| `this_ip` | **Mandatory.** The server's public IPv4. Used for the obfuscation seckey (derived from `this_ip` + `tcp_port`) and identity. | restart |
| `seed_servers` | List of `ip:port` seed servers to gossip with on start | restart |
| `version_major`, `version_minor` | Advertised version — **do not set below 17.15** | restart |

> **`this_ip` is required.** Set it to your server's public IP. The server-to-server
> obfuscation key is derived from `this_ip` + `tcp_port`, so it is stable across
> restarts and rotates automatically only if the IP or port changes.

> **Keep the version at 17.15 or higher.** Lugdunum servers reject servers
> advertising an older version and will not add them to their `server.met`
> (the 17.15 minimum was confirmed from the Lugdunum decompile). The default is
> 17.15; raising it is fine, lowering it gets you silently dropped from peer lists.

### `[network]`
| Key | Meaning | Apply |
|---|---|---|
| `tcp_port` | eD2k TCP port (default 4661). All UDP ports are derived from it (see below) | **restart** |
| `listen_ip` | Bind address for the listeners | restart |
| `listen_backlog`, `max_frame_size` | Socket / frame tuning | restart |
| `login_timeout_ms` | Login handshake timeout | restart |
| `support_crypt` | Advertise protocol obfuscation support | restart |
| `hairpin_lan_clients` | Let a client on the server's own network reach HighID (see below). Off by default | live |
| `highid_verify_observe` | **Observe only.** After a client gets HighID from the plain TCP probe, also send OP_HELLO in the background and count whether it answers with the user hash that logged in. Nothing changes for the client. Counters on the Status tab, cases in `/api/highid_mismatches`. Default off | live |
| `highid_downgrade_on_wrong_hash` | **Verdict.** The same background check, acted on: a port that answers with a *different* client's user hash marks (IP, port, login hash), and that client's next logins get LowID while the mark lasts (see below). Default off | live |
| `highid_wrong_hash_ttl_secs` | How long a wrong-hash mark lasts. Default 86400 (a day) | live |
| `ipv6_enabled` | Accept clients over IPv6 on the same TCP port, plus an IPv6 UDP socket on `tcp_port + 4`. Separate IPv6-only sockets, so the IPv4 path is unchanged; a host without IPv6 logs a warning and serves IPv4 only. Default off | restart |
| `listen_ip6` | Bind address for the IPv6 sockets. Default `::` | restart |
| `this_ip6` | The server's public IPv6, announced in `OP_SERVERIDENT` when `ipv6_publish_sources` is on. Empty = not announced | live |
| `ipv6_publish_sources` | Publish IPv6 sources to clients that can parse them, and advertise the extension in `OP_IDCHANGE` and UDP pings. Independent of `ipv6_enabled`. Default off | live |

> **UDP ports are derived from `tcp_port`, not configured.** The eD2k protocol
> fixes the whole UDP block relative to the TCP port, and seed servers compute a
> peer's ports the same way, so there is nothing to set:
>
> | Port | Purpose |
> |---|---|
> | `tcp_port + 4` | main eD2k UDP (searches, sources) |
> | `tcp_port + 8` | auxiliary UDP |
> | `tcp_port + 12` | server-to-server obfuscated ping |
> | `tcp_port + 14` | `portUDPobf` (obfuscated UDP) |
>
> Earlier versions had a separate `udp_port` key that had to be kept at
> `tcp_port + 4` by hand; a wrong value silently broke discovery. It has been
> removed. A stale `udp_port = ...` left in an old `config.toml` is ignored, so
> existing configs keep working without edits.

> **`hairpin_lan_clients` — for running a client on the same network as the
> server.** In that topology the client reaches the server through the router's
> hairpin NAT, so the login arrives from an RFC1918 address and the ordinary
> HighID probe refuses to even try: there is nothing useful to connect to at a
> private address. With this on, the server falls back to probing
> `server.this_ip` on the client's port — in that topology the client's public
> address is by definition the server's own.
>
> It runs only after the ordinary probe has already decided LowID, so it can add
> a HighID but never take one away, and it requires the peer to answer a
> client-to-client handshake with **the user hash that just logged in**. That
> check is what makes it safe: where a router source-NATs hairpin traffic, every
> local client arrives from the same address and cannot be told apart, so a port
> forward may well lead to a different machine. Without the identity check the
> server would hand the public address out as a source for the wrong host.
>
> Off by default because a server in a datacentre may see private addresses from
> a management network that has nothing to do with its public address.

> **HighID hello check (`highid_verify_observe`, `highid_downgrade_on_wrong_hash`).**
> HighID is decided by a TCP connect to the client's address and port. That
> proves *something* is listening there, not that it is this client. Behind a
> NAT shared by two eD2k clients — two machines at home, or strangers behind a
> provider's CGNAT where one of them has the port open — both claim the default
> port, the forward leads to one of them, and the other one used to get a HighID
> every peer is sent to the wrong machine by.
>
> With either option on, a client that passed the connect is also sent a
> client-to-client `OP_HELLO` in the background, and the user hash in its
> answer is compared with the one that logged in (the two client-type marker
> bytes are ignored: some clients send MLDonkey's in the hello and eMule's at
> login). The login is **never delayed** — a synchronous check was tried, and
> clients whose login is still pending mostly do not answer in time.
>
> In verdict mode a *different* hash marks (IP, port, login hash) for
> `highid_wrong_hash_ttl_secs`, and that client's next logins get LowID
> immediately, which lets it be reached through server callback. Its first
> session keeps the HighID. Every later login re-checks in the background: its
> own hash again (forwarding fixed) clears the mark, a wrong hash renews it.
>
> **No answer never costs HighID.** A silent close or a reset is what eMule's IP
> filter does to us, a timeout proves nothing, and Lugdunum-style "no answer →
> LowID" would take HighID from clients that are in fact reachable. Only a
> positive answer from another client counts. The hairpin path above is
> separate and unchanged.

### `[limits]`
| Key | Meaning | Apply |
|---|---|---|
| `max_clients` | Max concurrent clients | restart |
| `max_clients_per_ip` | Per-IP connection cap | restart |
| `soft_limit_files`, `hard_limit_files` | Per-client offered-file limits | restart |
| `max_string_size` | Max accepted string length | restart |
| `ping_delay_seconds` | Server keep-alive ping interval | restart |
| `max_search_results` | Results returned per search, across all pages; best-sourced first. Default 200, ceiling 5000. One value for every client — unlike Lugdunum, which varies it by zlib support and halves it for LowID | live |
| `search_rank_scan` | Candidates examined when ranking one search. Past it, ranking covers only what was seen; the share of searches that hit it is shown on the Status tab. Default 20000, must be ≥ `max_search_results` | live |
| `index_subtokens` | Also index letter/digit pieces of each word, so `S01E08` is found by `s01` and `e08`, `1080p` by `1080`. Changes what searches return, so off by default. Read once at startup: the index must split names the same way for its whole life. **Not a superset of Lugdunum**: a query that starts mid-run (`1x05` against `01x05`) is still not found | restart |
| `search_drop_unknown_words` | Ignore query words that no indexed file contains instead of returning nothing because of them (a typo no longer empties the search). A query of only unknown words still returns nothing; OR branches and negated words are never rewritten. Default on | live |

### `[content_filter]`
| Key | Meaning | Apply |
|---|---|---|
| `hash_banlist` | L3 ban-list file path(s) — blocked **and** counted against the publisher | **live** (file edit / reload) |
| `hash_filter` | L5 filter-only file path(s) — blocked, publisher **not** accused | **live** |
| `extra_terms_file` | L4 operator extra terms | **live** |
| `jargon_terms_file` | L1 jargon list | **live** |
| `layer2_terms_file` | L2 vocabulary (see below) | **live** |
| `whitelist_hashes_file` | Hash false-positive overrides (wins over every layer) | **live** |
| `publisher_attempt_disconnect_threshold` | Distinct blocked files tolerated before a publisher is banned (ban fires on the next one) | restart |
| `publisher_count_window_seconds` | How far back those files are counted. Defaults to `publisher_blacklist_seconds` | restart |
| `publisher_blacklist_seconds` | Ban duration (by user-hash) | restart |

> `hash_banlist` was `hash_blocklists` and `hash_filter` was `poison_hashes`
> before 0.9.71; the shipped filenames changed to match. See *Content filter*.

### `[updates]`

Optional; disabled by default. Fetches the filter data files from an update
service, verifies an Ed25519 signature over them, validates them with the same
parser that loads them at runtime, keeps rotating backups and installs
atomically. Full description, including how to run a service:
**[UPDATE-SERVICE.md](UPDATE-SERVICE.md)**.

| Key | Meaning | Apply |
|---|---|---|
| `enabled` | Master switch | live |
| `dest_dir` | Where files are installed; must match the paths above | live |
| `public_key` | Ed25519 public key (32 bytes, hex) files must be signed with | live |
| `require_signature` | Refuse anything unsigned. Leave on | live |
| `key_reference_ip` | The server whose exported peer table the service loaded | live |
| `backups` | Generations kept as `<name>.1` … `<name>.N` | live |
| `min_keep_ratio` | Refuse a replacement that shrinks the list below this fraction | live |
| `export_url`, `export_token`, `export_interval_secs` | Peer table export | restart |
| `[updates.urls]` | Per-file URLs | live |

> **`public_key` is public and `export_token` is not.** The key verifies a
> signature and cannot create one, so it is safe to ship and to commit. The token
> lets its holder push a peer table to the service and is issued per server —
> never copy one out of a repository, and never commit yours.

Updates are triggered from the **Health** tab, which lists every data file with
what is on disk and an **Update** button. The three hash lists additionally offer
**Update & merge**, which unions the download with the file already installed,
comparing hashes only and keeping whichever side carries the comment.

Nothing is written unless the signature verifies, the file parses and it would
not collapse the list — a failed update leaves the current file in place and says
why.

### `[storage]`
| Key | Meaning | Apply |
|---|---|---|
| `ipfilter_path` | Path to `guarding.p2p` | **live** (SIGHUP reload) |
| `country_db_path` | Path to `ip-to-country.csv` | restart |

### `[admin]`
| Key | Meaning | Apply |
|---|---|---|
| `enabled` | Enable the admin web panel | **restart** |
| `port` | Admin panel port (localhost-only) | **restart** |

### `[log]`, `[welcome]`, runtime
| Key | Meaning | Apply |
|---|---|---|
| `log.level`, `log.connection_trace` | Log verbosity (see logging note above) | restart |
| `welcome.messages` | MOTD lines sent on login | restart |
| `worker_threads` | Tokio worker threads (0 = auto) | restart |

**Live changes that take effect without a restart:** the CSAM filter lists —
**L1 jargon**, **L3 ban list(s)**, **L4 extra terms**, **L5 filter list(s)** and
the **hash whitelist** — all reload automatically within ~30 s of editing the
file, or immediately on `systemctl reload` / `POST /api/reload`. Copy list files
with `cp` and **not** `cp -p`: the watcher polls mtime, so preserving timestamps
means nothing reloads.

Changes take effect on **search results and source lists**, not just on new
publications — a hash added to either list disappears from what the server serves
within one reload cycle, with no restart.

## Content filter (CSAM)

The filter runs on every offered file and cannot be disabled. It has five layers:

- **L1 – jargon list** — known marker terms. The list is **not shipped** with the
  source (publishing a catalog of such terms is itself harmful). Supply your own
  via `jargon_terms_file`. Operators obtain indicators from authoritative bodies
  (INHOPE, IWF, NCMEC). Absent ⇒ L1 inactive; the other layers still run.
- **L2 – age + sexual-context heuristics** — compiled into the binary, works out
  of the box, no data file needed. This is the main heuristic layer.
- **L3 – ban list** (`hash_banlist`) — exact known-file hashes. Obtain from
  authoritative sources (NCMEC, IWF, Project Arachnid / C3P). These lists are
  typically licensed and **must not be redistributed** — keep them private.
  A hit here counts against the publisher.
- **L4 – operator extra terms** — optional additive substrings.
- **L5 – filter list** (`hash_filter`) — blocked like anything else, but the
  block carries **no accusation**: it does not raise `csam_attempts` and does not
  count toward `publisher_attempt_disconnect_threshold`.

### Why L3 and L5 are separate lists

Two things belong in `hash_filter`: **decoys** — one hash advertised under a
dozen unrelated names, a 700 MB file claiming at once to be a music compilation,
a film and an office installer — and **takedown requests**, where a rightsholder
complaint means the file should leave the index and says nothing about whoever
happens to share it.

Keeping those in the ban list did two kinds of damage: it pushed ordinary users
toward a ban for downloading a decoy, and it diluted a list whose whole value is
that every entry means one specific thing. `/api/review` reports blocklisted
hashes carrying several unrelated names or a size their extension cannot hold —
those are the candidates to move.

### Whitelist

`whitelist_hashes_file` overrides **every** layer, not just the hash lists. The
false positives that actually occur are term matches — song titles that happen to
contain a marker word, or historical texts whose title does — so an override that
left the term layers running did nothing for the one class of mistake that
happens in practice.

### Layer 2: age plus context

Layer 2's word lists live in `layer2_terms_file` rather than in the binary, and
hot-reload like the other lists. They change often, and a rebuild-and-restart per
change costs every connected client. With no file configured the built-in
vocabulary is used, which is what the server did before the option existed; a
file replaces the sections it names and leaves the rest alone. An unknown section
name rejects the whole file and keeps the previous lists, because a typo would
otherwise silently empty a category.

Layer 2 normally needs BOTH an age claim and a sexual term, so a birthday video
is not caught. Three refinements to that rule:

- **Ages of 12 and under stand alone.** Below 13 an age written into a filename
  is the anomaly by itself — legal material does not label participants "11yo".
  Only the compact notations (`yo`, `yr`) qualify; `12 years` is ordinary English
  and keeps the pairing rule, or "12 Years a Slave" would be blocked. Guard words
  near the number (`whisk`, `malt`, `service manual`) disqualify it.
- **Non-English contexts.** Russian minor/sexual word lists were added after a
  search sample found files with both halves written in plain Russian and nothing
  in any list covering them. These are ordinary words and work only behind the
  pairing rule — measured against legitimate Russian titles, a bare term list
  matched nine of thirteen.
- **Fixed innocent phrases override everything** (`SEX_TERM_EXCEPTIONS`). Some
  broad terms are common words inside set expressions — an idiom that is also a
  film title, the name of a school subject. Naming the phrase keeps the term
  usable; narrowing the term instead cost five of six real catches in testing.

Filenames damaged by repeated UTF-8/Latin-1 round-trips are recovered and
re-tested, so a CJK marker mangled into `Ã¥Â¹Â¼` still matches.

### Term matching

L1 and L4 share one matcher. A term is classified by length: **≥6 chars** →
substring match, **≤5** → word-boundary match. Three refinements matter:

- A long term must not begin immediately after an ASCII letter. Without this a
  six-character term that is a suffix of an ordinary English word fires inside
  it — one such term was a suffix of a common medical word and blocked every
  paper mentioning it.
- Digits and `_` separate, letters bind: `term_001`, `2term` and `term2011` all
  match, `aterm` and `termly` do not.
- A trailing `$` on a term additionally forbids digits and `_` after the match.
  Use it only when the term is the start of a longer innocent word.

Terms in CJK are exempt from the boundary rules — that script has no word
separators, so they match as plain substrings wherever they appear.

Template/format files are provided as `config/*.example`. The real list files are
git-ignored and never committed. Format: one entry per line, `#` comments allowed
(`;` inline comments too in the hash lists).

## NAT traversal (server side)

eD2k clients behind NAT get a **LowID** (no routable address). This server helps
such clients still exchange data, acting purely as a lightweight **coordinator**
— it relays small address packets over the TCP control channel it already has to
every logged-in client, and **never relays file data** (that would turn a light
index server into a bandwidth relay).

Two mechanisms are active:

- **Classic callback (HighID ↔ LowID).** When a HighID client wants a file from a
  LowID client, it sends `OP_CALLBACKREQUEST(low_id)`. The server validates the
  requester is HighID, finds the LowID client by its assigned id, and forwards
  `OP_CALLBACKREQUESTED(requester_ip, requester_port)` so the LowID side connects
  *out* to the reachable requester. On failure it returns `OP_CALLBACK_FAIL`.

- **LowID ↔ LowID hole-punch coordination.** Two LowID clients normally cannot
  connect at all — neither is reachable, so the stock callback doesn't help. Some
  eMule mods solve this with a Kademlia "buddy" HighID relay; this server needs
  neither Kad nor a third party. The flow (`src/server/holepunch.rs`):
  1. LowID **A** sends `OP_LOWID_HOLEPUNCH_REQUEST(target_id = B, requester_udp_port)`.
  2. The server looks up **B** among connected clients.
  3. The server sends `OP_LOWID_HOLEPUNCH_INFO` to **both** A and B, each carrying
     the other side's `(ip, tcp_port, udp_port, user_hash)` plus a role byte.
  4. Both clients fire UDP packets at each other simultaneously; with cone NAT on
     both sides this opens the path and a direct connection forms.

  The server sends only those two small address packets, and best-effort re-sends
  them a couple of times over the next few seconds so a lost/late packet on the
  TCP link doesn't leave the peers punching at non-overlapping times.

  To keep each client's observed public UDP endpoint fresh, clients send a
  periodic UDP NAT-T keepalive; the server also enables OS TCP keepalive on each
  accepted socket so a dropped NAT mapping is detected in ~5 minutes (and kept
  warm in the meantime).

### Implementing a compatible client (wire contract for eMule mods)

If you maintain an eMule mod and want your client to use this server's LowID↔LowID
NAT-T, this is the complete interface. Nothing else in the eD2k protocol changes,
and every tag/opcode below is backward-safe — a non-NAT-T client simply omits them.

**1. Advertise capability at login.** Add tag `CT_EMULE_UDPPORTS` (`0xF9`) to the
login request, value `((kadUDPPort << 16) | clientUDPPort)`. This tells the server
your client UDP port and flags you as NAT-T capable. Lugdunum-style servers already
parse `0xF9`, so sending it is safe against any server.

**2. Refresh your external UDP port — the keepalive (critical).** While connected,
send `OP_SERVER_NATT_KEEPALIVE` (`0x9F`) **from your client UDP socket** (not the TCP
link) to the server's UDP port (`= server TCP port + 4`), payload = your 16-byte
userhash, about every 60 s. The server reads the *source* port of this datagram to
learn your real post-NAT UDP port — the port peers must actually punch.

> **Timing invariant — do not get this wrong.** This server trusts an observed
> external UDP port for **600 s** (`OBSERVED_UDP_FRESH`). Your keepalive interval
> must stay well under that — ~60 s gives a 10× margin. If it lapses, the server
> falls back to your *announced* internal port and hands peers a port your NAT never
> opened. The symptom is distinctive and easy to misdiagnose: **freshly connected
> peers download fine, but hole punching stops a few minutes after connect** until a
> reconnect. The `0x9F` keepalive also doubles as your liveness signal (step 5), so a
> share-only LowID client must keep sending it.

**3. Client ↔ server opcodes** (travel over `OP_EDONKEYPROT`, the server link):

| Opcode | Value | Direction | Payload |
|---|---|---|---|
| `OP_LOWID_HOLEPUNCH_REQUEST` | `0x60` | client → server (TCP) | `<target_id 4><our_udp_port 2>` |
| `OP_LOWID_HOLEPUNCH_INFO` | `0x61` | server → both (TCP) | `<peer_ip 4><tcp 2><udp 2><userhash 16><role 1>` |
| `OP_LOWID_HOLEPUNCH_FAIL` | `0x62` | server → client (TCP) | `<target_id 4><reason 1>` |
| `OP_SERVER_NATT_KEEPALIVE` | `0x9F` | client → server (UDP) | `<userhash 16>` |

To download from a LowID source **B**, send `0x60` with B's assigned id and your UDP
port. The server replies `0x61` to **both** you and B — each gets the other's address
plus a role byte — or `0x62` if B is HighID, gone, or has a dead session. On `0x61`
both sides punch and raise the tunnel; on `0x62` retry or fall back. The `role` byte
is advisory: in the reference client both sides initiate, so order does not matter.
(`0x60`–`0x62` are unused in the server TCP opcode space, which runs `0x01`–`0x44`,
and `0x9F` was free in the server UDP namespace — no conflict on the server link.)

**4. Peer ↔ peer opcodes** (over `OP_EMULEPROT`, sent directly between the two
clients — **the server never sees these**; listed only so the full path is clear):
`OP_NATT_HOLEPUNCH` (`0xB3`, opens the pin-hole), `OP_NAT_SYN` / `OP_NAT_SYN_ACK`
(`0xD0`/`0xD1`, tunnel handshake), `OP_NAT_DATA` (`0xD2`, carries the tunnel packets),
and `0xD3`–`0xD7` (ack/close/reset/ping). The transport *inside* the tunnel is the
mod's own choice — the reference mod runs a UserModeTCP-over-QUIC tunnel — and the
server is agnostic to it. Both sides should send SYN (symmetric handshake) so the
peer behind the stricter NAT opens its own mapping; a per-run 4-byte session nonce on
`0xB3`/`0xD0`/`0xD1` lets a peer restart be detected and the stale tunnel rebuilt.

**5. Keep your LowID source alive.** A share-only client is TCP-silent for hours.
This server keeps such a source by **(a)** counting your `0x9F` UDP keepalive as
activity against the session idle timer (idle backstop is 900 s, refreshed by any
TCP frame *or* the UDP keepalive), **(b)** enabling OS TCP keepalive on the accepted
socket (first probe at 60 s, then every 30 s, give up after 8 → ~5 min) to keep the
NAT mapping warm and reap a genuinely dead peer, and **(c)** tolerating a multi-minute
NAT outage during a heavy transfer before reaping. Your only obligation is to keep
sending the `0x9F` keepalive; the rest is the server's bookkeeping. Get the cadence
wrong and a live share-only source is silently evicted after a few minutes — the
symptom is identical to a successful connection, which makes it easy to misdiagnose.

## IPv6

Off by default; two independent switches in `[network]`:

- `ipv6_enabled` — **accept** clients over IPv6. A separate IPv6-only TCP
  listener on `tcp_port` and UDP socket on `tcp_port + 4`; the IPv4 sockets are
  untouched.
- `ipv6_publish_sources` — **publish** IPv6 sources to peers that can parse
  them. Kept separate because it changes what other peers receive.

An eD2k client id is a 32-bit IPv4 address, so there is no such thing as an
IPv6 HighID. A client connected over IPv6 is LowID on IPv4 by construction and
is never probed. What IPv6 adds is a second way to reach a LowID client: its
IPv6 address, handed to peers as a source.

### Wire contract

Agreed with the two other implementations that speak it, eMuleQt and eNode-go.
Every element is ignored by a client that does not know it.

| Direction | Element | Value | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| client → server | login tag `CT_MOD_IP_V6` | `0xAE`, 16 raw bytes | the client's public IPv6 |
| client → server | `CT_SERVER_FLAGS` bit | `0x1000` | client can parse IPv6 sources |
| server → client | `OP_IDCHANGE` flags / UDP ping flags bit | `0x4000` | server speaks the extension |
| server → client | `OP_SERVERIDENT` tag `ST_IPV6` | `0xAE`, 16 raw bytes | the server's IPv6 (`this_ip6`) |
| server → client | `OP_SERVERIDENT` tag `ST_IPV6_STATUS` | `0xAB`, u8 | `0x01` address held, `0x02` treated as reachable |
| server → client | source record in `OP_FOUNDSOURCES` / UDP answer | id `0xFFFFFFFF`, port, then 16 bytes | an IPv6 source |

The client-flag bit (`0x1000`) and the server-flag bit (`0x4000`) are different
numbers on purpose; they must not be "unified".

Rules the server applies:

- The address a session actually arrived from is preferred over the one the
  tag claims: an observed address over an asserted one.
- Only a globally usable IPv6 is published — never link-local, unique-local,
  loopback, multicast or IPv4-mapped.
- An IPv6 record is sent only for a source that is LowID on IPv4 (a HighID
  source is reachable already), and only to a requester that can parse it: a
  TCP client that sent the tag or connected over IPv6, or a UDP query that
  arrived over IPv6.
- Answers carrying IPv6 records bypass the source cache, which is shared with
  clients that cannot parse them.

## Server lists & IP filter

- **Seed servers** (`server.seed_servers`): get a current list from
  **https://www.emule-security.org/serverlist** or **https://peerates.net/**.
- **IP filter**: the server reads **guarding.p2p** in the same format used by
  emule-security / eMule (`start_ip - end_ip , level , description`). Per-range
  block-hit statistics are available in the admin panel's *Filter* tab.

---

## Admin web panel & SSH tunnel

The admin panel binds to **localhost only** (`127.0.0.1:<admin.port>`, default
8080) and is **not** exposed to the internet. To reach it from your PC, forward
the port over SSH.

### With PuTTY (Windows)

1. Open **PuTTY**. Enter your VPS host/IP under *Session*.
2. In the left tree: **Connection → SSH → Tunnels**.
3. **Source port:** `8080` · **Destination:** `127.0.0.1:8080` · select
   **Local**, then click **Add** (you should see `L8080  127.0.0.1:8080`).
4. Go back to **Session**, save it, and **Open** — log in as usual.
5. While that session is connected, open **http://127.0.0.1:8080/** in your
   browser. You now see the panel served from the VPS.

> If the page is unreachable, the tunnel is down (e.g. the SSH session dropped or
> the server restarted) — reconnect the PuTTY session. The localhost binding is by
> design; nothing in the server needs changing.

Command-line SSH (Linux/macOS/WSL) equivalent:

```bash
ssh -N -L 8080:127.0.0.1:8080 user@your-vps
```

The panel shows live status, connected clients, peers/servers, filter info and
per-range IP-filter hits, blocks, and memory metrics (RSS plus the non-evictable
in-use bytes and per-file cost). The Status tab also carries search counters
(ranking cap hits, unknown words dropped), IPv6 clients and publishers, and the
HighID hello-check counters.

`GET /api/highid_mismatches` exports the recent wrong-hash cases of the HighID
check (the last 1000) with a summary: which answering clients are connected
from the same address, repeated addresses and hashes, and whether a mark was
set. `?anonymize=1` replaces each address with its /24 plus a per-process salted
tag, so repeats stay visible and the export can be shared.
